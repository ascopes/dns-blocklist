Note: This license only covers the content of the repository. Generated lists are
licensed by each section that is mentioned in the license headers of the corresponding 
list. 

Lists are distributed in a modified format to concatenate them into a single file,
and to then remove duplicates, normalize patterns, and compact overly computationally
expensive expressions together.

Please refer to the distributor of each list for the current copy of the list, or a
copy for any point in time in the past. History is not tracked for this aggregated list
as it is not feasible to retain previous copies.
